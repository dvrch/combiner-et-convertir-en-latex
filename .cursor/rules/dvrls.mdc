# Obsidian Markdown Combiner Plugin

**Objective:** Develop an Obsidian plugin that combines the content of a main Markdown file with its linked Markdown files (e.g., `![[another_note]]`). The plugin should recursively include content from nested links, resulting in a single, consolidated Markdown file.

**Technology Stack:**
*   **Framework:** Svelte (targeting version 4, as version 5 has known issues). All core functionalities should be implemented using Svelte components.
*   **Language:** svelte 4 (+TypeScript  
*   **Package Manager:** pnpm

**Core Principles:**
*   **Simplicity & Logic:** The code should be easy to understand and follow clear logical patterns.
*   **Intelligence & Flexibility:** The plugin should be robust enough to handle various linking scenarios and allow for future expansions (e.g., integration with external data sources like APIs or YAML files).
*   **Usability & Collaboration:** The plugin should be intuitive for users and designed for easy maintenance and collaborative development.

**Inspiration/Reference:**
The plugin's core functionality is inspired by the Python workflow found at `/c:\Users\dvrch\Desktop\4plug\.obsidian\plugins\Straightforward-Obsidian2Latex-DV`. While that workflow targets LaTeX output, this plugin aims to achieve similar Markdown consolidation directly within Obsidian. We seek a more robust and simpler parsing logic than the referenced Python workflow, potentially exploring structured data approaches (e.g., YAML-like syntax for configuration or linking).
